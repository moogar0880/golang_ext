==========

Golang Ext Provides two key pieces of functionality. Or, at least it *will*. Eventually...

First off, it provides a pythonic way of writing and building Python
extensions in Go.

Secondly, it provides a module similar to Python's builtin `ctypes

exposes a thin wrapper around some of Go's more pertinent internals.
